# Knight Online

This is the official Knight Online repository containing Game, Server and Tools sources.

Before opening any of the projects, make sure you clone the vendor directory:
```
cd src
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/stevewgr/ko-vendor.git vendor
```

It contains portable SDKs to build the project without having to install additional tools.

The only software you need to install for now is Visual Studio 2022.
